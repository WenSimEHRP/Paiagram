Paiagram is a timetable editor and visualizer that easily runs on any modern potatoes. I've verified this on my high school's desktops.

## Features

- A graph for organizing your stations and intervals. The graph is also the sole truth for station connectivity.
- Create diagrams from arbitrary nodes -- the program handles it, don't worry. Your vehicle data is not tied to the diagram.
- Translations! You can use the app in Klingon if you wish to -- you'd need to translate it first, obviously.
- Import your favourite OuDiaSecond and qETRC/pyETRC diagrams using the builtin import feature.
- Try it on the web! You can download the app bundle and use it directly in your browser without installation. It works completely offline!
  There's also an online build: <https://wensimehrp.github.io/Paiagram>
