and #link("http://oudiasecond.seesaa.net/")[OuDiaSecond] are popular Japanese timetabling applications. Paiagram
provides builtin support for reading their output formats, `.oud` and `.oud2`.

You can also checkout the #link("https://wensimehrp.github.io/oudia-to-kdl/")[oud-to-kdl] converter to convert both file
formats to #link("https://kdl.dev/")[KDL] in case if you want to process the `oud` format using a custom script.
