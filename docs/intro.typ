Since you are looking at this page, I would assume you are interested in some aspects of transport. You might be
interested in railway locomotives, bento boxes, tracks and yards, or operation in general. In Paiagram, we figure out
how to make transport timetables and visualize them.

Let's take a look at what Paiagram can do:

- Make timetables for your model transportation system
- Visualize and simulate vehicle movement at any given time point
- Diagnose your timetables.

Paiagram is not an all-in-one tool where you would find every single feature related with timetabling, though. However,
if you do want something to be added into the program, #link("https://github.com/WenSimEHRP/Paiagram/issues")[feel free
  to open a ticket!]
