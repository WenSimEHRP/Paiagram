Since you are looking at this page, I would assume you are interested in some aspects of transport. You might be
interested in railway locomotives, bento boxes, tracks and yards, or operation in general. In Paiagram, we figure out
how to make transport timetables and visualize them.

Let's take a look at what Paiagram can do:

- Make timetables for your model transportation system
- Visualize and simulate vehicle movement at any given time point
- Diagnose your timetables.

Paiagram is not an all-in-one tool where you would find every single feature related with timetabling, though. However,
if you do want something to be added into the program, #link("https://github.com/WenSimEHRP/Paiagram/issues")[feel free
  to open a ticket!]

= Getting Started

If you have any trouble using the application, feel free to ask in #link(links.discussions)[GitHub discussions], or in
our QQ group chat: #raw(links.qq).

You can use the #link(links.home)[web version] or the desktop version. The web version runs on Chromium 113+. Latest
versions of Firefox and Safari are also supported. You would, unfortunately, have to compile the desktop version
yourself.

The performance gap between both versions when processing small datasets is usually acceptable.
